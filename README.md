# SonoHand by FullDuplex Group

We are the FullDuplex group and we obtained the 4th place (based on 15 groups) in the Hackathon Facebook Chile 2018 by our project called 'SonoHand'. This project was based on the creation of an algorithm that uses digital image processing to compose music. Particularly, the algorithm is capable to generate in real time different audible sinusoidal tones, depending on the position of the hand captured by the camera. In addition, this code generates a high quality MIDI audio file and a specialized musical score (sheet music).

## Important Remark

Before using the code, it is necessary to install the LilyPond software, which can be downloaded from the following link: [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/download.es.html)
